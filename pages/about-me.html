						<h2>Where I'm from.</h2>
						<p>I come from Banbridge, more specifically a little village called Loughbrickland.
							Although when interested people from England ask, I say "Northern Ireland",
							and then if they ask "Oh where abouts?", I ask them if they've ever visited,
							and most of the time they say "No, but my Nannie's ex-boyfriend is from Limerick"
							or something equally as obscure. So I say "About 30 miles south of Belfast".
							And if anyone asks me if I'm Irish, I'm one of the people that normally is bothered to correct them to Northern Irish.
							<br/>I took holidays in a caravan, which was absolutely great. Thanks dad!
							<br/>I went to Banbridge Academy which was pretty good. I was always pretty good at numbers. So worked hard at that.
							<br/>Much of my maths skills are owed to Mr. Irwin, Mr. Farrell, Mr. Miskelly and Mrs. Campbell.
							<br/>Couldn't stand Geography with Miss Bryson or History with anyone, but Miss Poots might be surprised how much Spanish I still know and use. 
							<br/>By 6th Form I was studying as many number based subjects as I could, and finally decided to study maths at LANCASTER!!!!!!

						<h2>Uni</h2>
						<p>So I went to Lancaster and made some excellent friends! Suki, Laura, Liam, Rakesh, Abi, Vicki, Steph and Jordan, to name the most important ones.
							<br/>Nobody called Gemma.
							<br/>I did some studying of maths, and some rowing, fell in love, got into hip-hop music and debt, did some epic partying, and then stressed out to the max and learned
							<br/>a) a whole load of easy to forget maths, and 
							<br/>b) the infinitely more valuable skill of how to learn things well.
							<br/>
							<br/>We finished up, and Suki and I decided to move to London.
							<br/>Suki was to work "in telly" as she bluntly puts it, and me as a teacher of Art and PE.
							<br/>
							<br/>Just kidding. Maths, obviously.

						<h2>Moving to London and Being a teacher.</h2>
						<p>This was great. I was full of enormous ideas about how I would teach the best lessons ever and be most kids favourite teacher.
						<br/>It's not that simple. It involves a lot of hard work that most people don't see.
						<br/>Like some senior management, I forget very quickly what it's like to mark tons of books and teach a full timetable now that I'm not doing it.
						<br/>But I did have some pretty great lessons, and a few kids told me I was their favourite teacher, which was a pretty nice feeling.
						<br/>I also initiated a cake day. Every friday. Some call it odd and ridiculous, I called it breakfast.
						<br/>After a year at Coopers' School out in Essex. I moved to an inner city school.
						<br/>Unfortunately for everyone, it wasn't a good fit.
						<br/>I decided, for many reasons, like <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/nov/14/secret-teacher-cant-bear-ofsted-going-teach-australia">this,</a> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/may/30/secret-teacher-astonished-some-parents-complain-about">this</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2014/nov/22/secret-teacher-fear-sick-leave">this</a>, to stick a pin in teaching under the "may revisit when much older" section of life, and explore other stuff I was good at.
						<br/>Chess, differentiating simple equations, and playing CoD weren't yielding much life satisfaction/income, so I put my efforts into ...

						<h2>Learning to code stuff</h2>
						<p>In the summer after finishing my PGCE, I had 6 weeks until my job started properly
							<br/>(Although I started at start of July, it wasn't really really work, and getting paid over the summer felt like fraud when I hadn't done much. However I realised soon after, it wasn't for no reason.)
							<br/>I couldn't stand being idle for 6 weeks, and eventually built a BBQ from bricks I ordered from wickes.
							This didn't take up much time, but I was a massive fan of Apple in every aspect, most particularly their for user interfaces.
							<br/>They released a new programming language called swift, which made a lot of noise for being a great language, and easy (or easier than Objective C) to learn.
							<br/>So I started to learn. And it was loads of fun! I really enjoyed learning the nuances of programming and coming up with handy functions to save time. <a href="https://gist.github.com/linenoise/1323575">But not to this level.</a>
							<br/>Perl Programmers can take it too far!
							<br/>A year and a bit later, Around the time I was looking to make a move out of teaching and into programming, my good buddy Tom (who also likes chess, maths and programming) had recently got a job at a company, and he said I'd love it.
							<br/>Que, GameSys!

						<h2>Have fun, making fun!</h2>
						<p><a href="http://www.gamesyscorporate.com">GameSys</a> is an online slots/bingo/casino gaming company, and I work in the Business Intelligence Systems team.
							<br/>We make reconcile data in the DataWarehouse to make sure it's accurate, give people in the business information on things like Player Activity, Corporate Finance, Partner and Acquisition information, Anti Money Laundering, basically whatever they need.
							<br/>It's a great team, and we work under tight deadlines to get stuff done ASAP.
							<br/>We use program using SQL (structured query language) to find results, update information, insert new data and very very very very carefully delete stuff. That's a mistake best not repeated.
							<br/>Bill is the main man, and he asked me one day to format an email to send out a little neater, in HTML format.
							<br/>So I built some basic skills from Codecademy and did that.
							<br/>But it was interesting, so I kept learning, until BAM! You're here reading this page I made.
