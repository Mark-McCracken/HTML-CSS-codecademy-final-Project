						<h3>The Duke of Edinburgh's award</h3>
						<p>That was really fun. Did the whole camping out, falling in a puddle,
								enduring thoroughly British weather and not during the summertime.
							<br/>Here's a picture of me camping. Not during duke of ed, but sometime later cause that was fun.
							<br/>I did tae-kwon-do as a sport, learned how to drive (like a pro), and helped out at my local Boys Brigade.
								Spent 5 days away for the residential and this was enough to make me realise I should move countries.

						<p>Much credit must go to Julien Ducret from <br/><a href="http://www.agencymobile.co.uk">Agency Mobile</a><br/> who helped me a lot with this, and showed me some awesome tricks to refactor my code to make it easier, shorter and safer.

						<h3>Developed and Maintained a KDR of CoD 4 of 2.45</h3>

							<br/>Every gold gun? Damn Straight.
							<br/>Best Setup? Dead Silence, Marathon, Lightweight, Tactical Knife.
							<br/>That was a long time ago and they don't make CoD like they used to, so here's me slaying it in Halo 5 -> (click)
